Internal stylesheet: This stylesheet can be embedded inside the <head> tag by using <style> tag
After Externka stylesheet, Internal stylesheets are the best to implement styles to specific webpage or HTML file.

# Question 7 ❓

What are the primary text properties used in CSS to modify the appearance and layout of text?

### Answer 🔑

Some primary text properties include `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `text-transform`, `line-height`, and `text-indent`.

# Question 8 ❓

In what scenarios might it be beneficial to use `vh` or `vw` as a unit for font size?

### Answer 🔑

`vh` (viewport height) and `vw` (viewport width) are relative to the size of the viewport. Using these units can be beneficial when you want text to be responsive to the size of the viewport. For instance, if you want a headline always to occupy a certain percentage of the viewport's width or height, using `vh` or `vw` can achieve that.

# Question 9 ❓

Explain the difference between `em` and `rem` units.

### Answer 🔑

Both `em` and `rem` are relative units in CSS. `em` is relative to the font size of its closest parent, whereas `rem` is relative to the root (usually the `<html>`) element's font size. This means if you have nested elements with font sizes specified in `em`, they can compound, while `rem` will always remain consistent relative to the root.

# Question 10 ❓

If multiple font families are listed in the font-family property, how does the browser decide which one to display?

### Answer 🔑

The browser will try to use the fonts in the order they are listed. If the first font is not available on the user's system or through linked font resources, the browser will attempt to use the next font in the list, and so on. It's a fallback mechanism to ensure that if a specific font isn't available, the text can still be displayed in an alternative font.
